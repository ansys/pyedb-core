The Electronics Database (EDB) is a format for storing information describing designs for the Ansys Electronic Desktop (AEDT). This Python API makes calls to an EDB Server that can be run locally or remotely.

Currently the server can create, edit, read and write EDBs to disk. After that, those EDBs can be read into AEDT and simulated.

Choose :ref:`ref_index_api` to access a complete description of all the available Python classes and functions.
