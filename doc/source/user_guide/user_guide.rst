**[Ansys Internal - Confidential]**

The classes and functions are in the **ansys.edb** namespace

The Electronics Database (EDB) API allows access and manipulation of EDB databases. Design types managing Layout data in ANSYS Electronics Desktop have a corresponding aedb directory alongside the aedt file -- the aedb directory contains the EDB database. EDB databases can also be created by ANSYS translators, or by using these API functions directly; the resulting EBD can then be imported into ANSYS Electronics Desktop.
