**[Ansys Internal - Confidential]**

The classes and functions are in the **ansys.edb** package.

The Electronics Database (EDB) API allows access and manipulation of EDB databases. Design types managing Layout data in Ansys Electronics Desktop have a corresponding aedb directory alongside the AEDT file -- the aedb directory contains the EDB database. EDB databases can also be created by Ansys translators, or by using these API functions directly; the resulting EDB can then be imported into Ansys Electronics Desktop
